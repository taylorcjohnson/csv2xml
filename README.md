# csv2xml
Python script that converts .csv to .xml file format

### Abstract
Python script to convert existing .CSV files to .XML file format.  The current .XML structure support's ESRI Story Maps or the recently developed [geoPhotoViewer](https://github.com/taylorcjohnson/geoPhotoViewer_v0-2).

### Version
The script is at version 1.0 and has been tested for ArcGIS 10.2.2

### Updates
Eventually, a full Tkinter (or Qt) user interface should be developed.  This is will remove any command-line dependencies while also not be required to run inside of ArcGIS/ArcCatalog (though it could be re-written as an ESRI tool).
